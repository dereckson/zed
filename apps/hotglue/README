KNOWN ISSUES

  * Hotglue 1.0 is not compatible with prior versions of the software. We aim 
    to preserve compatibility with upcoming releases though.
  
  * If you receive an error message while uploading a large file this 
    might  be due to the limits set in the servers's php.ini file.
    You might want to change the values of these settings:
    - post_max_size
    - upload_max_filesize
    - memory-limit (if memory limits have been enabled)
    - max_input_time
    - max_file_uploads
